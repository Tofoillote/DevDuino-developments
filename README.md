# DevDuino Joysticks developments

These are my "from scratch" interpretation of the use of Joysticks.
Read the Joystick X and Y returned values, relay those value to PWM and logical outpouts to drive some motor controler boards.

Works with potentiometer and hall effect joysticks.


The whole job focuses on adding motors to wheelchair for added freem and independence experience.

Thanks to Alexandre Pailhoux Devduino board https://devduino.cc/ making it real via his Kickstarter campaign.
